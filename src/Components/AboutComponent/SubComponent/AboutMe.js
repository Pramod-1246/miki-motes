            I started illustrating as a newborn and haven't stopped since - my ugly,
            creepy creatures have always been with me. I use them to communicate my thoughts and others' musings as well. 
            I illustrate for brands, design <a href="#stickers">Stickers for IM apps</a>,<a href="#decorate">decorate offices</a>, design <a href="#growth">growth charts for kids'
            rooms</a> , partake in and abundance of silly things and basically use my design abilities any way I can.
            I'd love to find my next project - <a href="#talk">let's talk</a>!
